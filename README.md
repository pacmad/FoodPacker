# Welcome to FoodPacker

This Software was written to calculate and manage Food Boxes on a scout camp
organised by german scouts of the VCP in Hessia.

After the first camp in 2012 it was reused for a camp in 2016.

The software was written in ruby on rails, because at that time in 2012 I wanted to learn rails.

Because it was originally written for only german users the UI localization may be incomplete or
wrong in english.

You are free to use this software for whatever you like under the terms and conditions of the
MIT-Licence in the Licence file. If you are using it to plan food for a camp I would love to hear about that.
